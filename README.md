# DL_Specialization

This repository contains my implementations of programming assignments from **Deep Learning Specialization** taught by *Andrew Ng* through Coursera. This specialization aims to help the subscribers to understand deep learning fundamentals, apply them, and build a
career in AI. There are five courses in this specialization:



1.  **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**
2.  **Improving Deep Neural Networks**
3.  **Structuring Machine Learning Projects** (which has no programming assignment, so I haven't Included it in the repo.)
4.  **Convolutional Neural Networks**
5.  **Sequence Models** (that I skipped it because I wanted to take another full course ([CS224n](https://github.com/hsmirzaie/CS224n)) on the subject of NLP first)
