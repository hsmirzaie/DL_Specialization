# Repository Discription
Each course is divided into Week wise directories (Maximum upto Week4). This repositpory mainly contains the programming assignments which I have completed during the course. Main file of assignments is [.ipynb] jupyter notebook. [images] folder contains the images which are used in jupyter notebok. [.py] files are the helping scripts for particular assignment. I have also uploaded quizes [.md] of few weeks.
